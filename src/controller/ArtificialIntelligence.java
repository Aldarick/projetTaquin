/**
 * In this class will be stored all the algorithms which are used to resolve the puzzle
 *
 * Possible ideas :
 *      - Solve with A* (requested by the teacher)
 *      - Solve with Dijkstra
 *      - Give hints to the player
 *
 * We will need to implement new functions in the GameGrid class so the AI is aware of the game :
 *      - Return the grid
 *      - Comparison between two Grids (which one is closer to the solution) :
 *          - equals()
 *          - hashCode() (maybe)
 *      - Return the position of a given value
 *      - Return the value of a given position
 *      - Return the distance between two tiles
 *
 *      And other functions but I'm not omniscient, 'kay?
 *
